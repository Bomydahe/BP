<Path
  key={index}
  d={path.d}
  stroke={path.stroke}
  strokeWidth={(path.strokeWidth / 100) * width} // convert strokeWidth back to pixels
  fill="none"
/>

By doing this, you ensure that the strokeWidth is consistent across 
different devices and components, as it will always be relative to the 
screen width (or height, if you choose to use height instead).
